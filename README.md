# KiKi-Pi-One
# 16-Bit CPU Design and Simulation Project

## Overview

Welcome to the KiKi-Pi-One project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of computer architecture by designing a 16-bit Central Processing Unit (CPU) and simulating it using Logisim Evolution, a powerful digital logic simulator.

## Introduction

In this project, we have designed a 16-bit CPU architecture, taking into consideration various aspects of computer organization and design. The CPU is implemented in Logisim, a graphical tool for designing and simulating digital circuits.

## Features

- 16-bit instruction set architecture
- ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- Control Unit
- Register File
- Memory Unit
- Clock and Reset handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the simulation, make sure you have the following installed:

- Logisim Evolution v3.8.0: [Download Logisim Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/releases/tag/v3.8.0)


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SreejitS/KiKi-Pi-One.git
   ```

2. Open Logisim and load the CPU circuit file:

   ```
   /Logisim-Evolution/KiKi_Pi_One.circ
   ```

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `Logisim-Evolution/KiKi_Pi_One.circ`: Logisim circuit file for the 16-bit CPU.
- `Docs/`: Documentation for the projecs, use [draw.io](draw.io) to view the system diagram.

## Simulation

1. Open Logisim and load the CPU circuit file.

2. Simulate the CPU by clicking on the "Simulate" button.

3. Use Logisim's interface to observe the CPU's behavior, including register values, memory access, and instruction execution.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for the CPU design, architecture, and implementation can be found in the `docs/` directory. This includes information on the instruction set, register layout, and the overall design philosophy.
